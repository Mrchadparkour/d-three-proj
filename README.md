<ul>
  <li>This is my first time using D3, and there is a ton to learn but its awesome!</li>
  <li>Have a minimal Mobx-store on this project, but I still like it more than pure react</li>
  <li>Followed two things for guidance, A tutorial on HackerNoon about building D3 Components in React, and some inspiration from Polar Clock.</li>
  <li>Next D3 project's goal will be to make a one of a kind design</li>
</ul>
